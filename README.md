# xgb-ngrams

Toy webapp for exploring "interactions" between predictors in xgboost trees. Decision trees in an xgboost ensemble are parsed, and features that are used sequentially are considered to indicate possible dependencies between features.

Inspired by [xgbfi](https://github.com/Far0n/xgbfi).
